# Tweets character limit
### General information
Recently with the rise of social media platforms like Twitter stand out. Allowing the user to 'tweet' something. This can include a message and/or a picture. In 2017 Twitter increased the maximum tweet length from 140 characters to 280. The average tweet or average word length in tweets around this time could paint a picture on how the change in such a limit would affect the tweets. Social media companies might be interested in knowing if character limits matter.

# Background information
Some research has been done for example that of Smirnov; showing a relation between academic performance and the complexity of their tweets [1]. Other research shows a change in behaviour after the increase of the limit, where before the increase more abbreviations were used than after [2].

# Research question and hypothesis
**Research question:** Did the increase in a Twitter message length have an effect on average tweet or word length?

**Hypotheses:** The average length of tweets increased by 50% after the increase of the character limit.

# Method
The Twitter corpus made and maintained by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen will be used. These tweets range from 2010 to the current day. Because 2023 is not over yet the tweets from that year will be excluded. It is however important to mention that in 2023 the character limit was increased to 4000 for users with 'Twitter blue'. This could be interesting to investigate in the future.

We will be running a program which will output certain data: the average word length of a tweet, the average tweet length, the average word length of the tweets and more.
